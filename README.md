# YordhailAssignmentWebsite
This website is done for computer programming class; It is the second assignment of the second semester.
I have used tags and syntax introduced to me by my instructers. I tried to make my own website from scrath to challenge my-self and implement the necessary steps
to produce the project.
The website introduces me espacially my designing skills and a charity organization.
